This plugin is very much inspired by Tim Pope's pathogen and extends
it with a functionality of loading seldomly used plugins later.

Install in ~/.vim/autoload (or ~\vimfiles\autoload) together with pathogen
(http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332).

You can use pathogen's settings to configure ipi, e.g. disable plugins
completely.

For loading plugins later, install them in ~/.vim/ipi (or
~\vimfiles\ipi). Adding `call ipi#inspect()` to your .vimrc will create a
list of plugins that can be loaded later. For loading a single or multiple
plugins use the LL command:

Load gundo plugin later:
:LL gundo

Load gundo and speeddating plugins later:
:LL gundo speedating

Load all known plugins later:
:LL!
