This plugin is very much inspired by Tim Pope's pathogen and complements it
with the functionality of loading infrequently used plugins later.

Install in ~/.vim/autoload (or ~\vimfiles\autoload) together with pathogen
(http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332).

You can use pathogen's settings to configure ipi, e.g. disable plugins
completely.

For loading plugins later, install them in ~/.vim/ipi (or ~\vimfiles\ipi).
Adding `call ipi#inspect()` to your .vimrc. It will create a list of plugins
that can be loaded later by using the LL command:

Load gundo plugin later:
:LL gundo

Load gundo and speeddating plugins later:
:LL gundo speedating

Load all known plugins later:
:LL!
